The importance of learning languages is rapidly increasing day by day. Therefore, the question of which learning methods are more 
efficient became an important issue. Hence, the aim of this project is collecting data and 
analysing it to investigate the answer to this question.

The data was collected among METU students who learn a foreign language except English. 
Students were asked which applications they use or courses they attend, how much time they 
spend on a weekly basis and in total, whether they need to learn a new alphabet, and how they 
rate the efficiency of the application/course. 

For the analysis, hypothesis testing and Poisson regression were conducted. As a result, the 
average efficiency of applications and courses is not significantly different. The average 
learning progress differs significantly depending on the total spent time. The average learning 
progress does not change significantly according to other factors such as, weekly spend time, 
learning a new alphabet, and learning methods. 

Due to privacy/licensing restrictions, the dataset used in this project is **not included** in the repository.
